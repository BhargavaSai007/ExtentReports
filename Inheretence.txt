Inheritence || Abstraction || Polymorphism || Encapsulation
OBJECT CREATION MATTERS A LOT
Multiple inheretence is not allowed at class level but allowed at interface level;

Inheritence extends is key word, applied for classes 
Has a relation ship is property based; composition||Aggregation
IS A relationship is important [DOG IS A ANIMAL]
Dog extends Animal 
Child can use parent but parent can not use parent 

Inherit property of other class; one class using property of other class
Single,Multiple,Hierarchial, multi level;

Animal having cat and dog clases is hierarichal inheritance
siblings can not share the properties 

Why Multiple Inheritence is not possible at class level ?
