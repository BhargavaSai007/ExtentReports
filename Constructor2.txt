Every child class will call the parent class constructor. It need not be proved If no 
constructor. Only one constructor should be called.


when there is no user defined default constructor will be called. 
this(10)==child(int a);
super(20)== parent(int b);

Default parent class constructor will be called.
To call the parametre constructor JVM will not take decisions. Pass the value is by child class


In child class constructor the first call will be parent constructor;
Child extends Parent {
child(){	
syso"Child constructor "
super(10);
}
main(){
Child cobj=new Obj();
}
}
