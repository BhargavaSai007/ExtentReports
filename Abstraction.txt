ABSTRACTION AND INTERFACE

SUMMARY:
ABSTRACT CANNOT BE DECLARED WITH FINAL
ABSTRACT CLASS CANNOT HAVE OBJECTS; NO BODY FOR METHODS [forceful implementation]
STATIC METHODS CAN BE CALLED WITHOUT OBJ CREATIONS.
IF WANT TO MAKE OVERRIDING MANDATORY FOR CHILD CLASS THEN MAKE PARENT CLASS ABSTRACT;
IF CLASS CONTAINS ABSTRACT METHOD THEN CLASS SHOULD BE ASTRACT IN NATURE;
IN AN ABSTRACT CLASS WE CAN HAVE BOTH ABSTARCT AND CONCRETE METHOD;
NOT MANDATORY TO HAVE ONE ABSTARCT METHOD IN ABSTRACT CLASS;
ABSTRACT METHOD MEANS CANNOT HAVE BODY{}; public abstract void click();

FINAL CAN BE USED BY VARIABLES,CLASSES,METHODS they become constant;

ABSTRACT Incomplete unfinished or prototype not concrete 
IN JAVA ABSTRACT CLASS CAN ONLY CONTAIN ABSTRACT METHODS
If child extends parent who is abstract class, Child needs 
to provide implementation for all methods.
Rule for overriding method signatre should be same;
