OverLoading[Compile time, Early Binding]
OverRiding [RunTime, Late Binding] 

Implemented at Method level only; 
Method name and parameters is MethodSignature.

OVERRIDING [SAME METHOD NAME AND SAME PARAMETRES in different class]
 
OVERLOADING [Same method name with different parametres]

In class we have mutiple methods with same name but with DIFFERENT PARAMETRES
RUNTIME issues; While passing values sending two or three parametres 
when not sure create same method and overload the method by adding parametres.
